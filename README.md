# Mask Detection Via YOLOV5



## Library Required:

- opencv
- PyQt5 (pip install PyQt5)
- pytorch (pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113)



## Notice:

This project is about object detection, so that it will be better to use a computer with GPU to run the program. The computer must have installed CUDA, and the pytorch version should support CUDA 11.3



## Tutorial:

- Direct run the python file **detect.py**

- Wait for a moment for the program download the YOLOV5 algorithm from internet
- If the program is successfully executed there will be a GUI window
- Click the "Start Detect" button to open the computer camera to detect whether the person is wearing mask
- Check checkbox "Plot Box" to plot rectangle for object detected and show the confidence
- Check checkbox "Plot FPS" to plot FPS
- Click the "Stop Detect" button to stop detecting
- After terminate the program, it will record a video for the last detection
